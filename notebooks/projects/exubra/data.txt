Narrator talking about olivers dream: 
“Horse walks into bar.
Barman says:? why the long face?. Ha… 
Horse says:? what?
Barman says:? oh its a joke i mean tha-
Horse says: "Yeah, I've heard it before. Uh-"?
"-being that I'm, in fact, a horse, and..."?
Barman says: "Okay, look, i-it was just a joke."?
And Horse says: "...secondly, frankly-"?
“I’d rather be a horse than a glorified drink dispensing machine working in a dive like this” 
"-you degenerate little scrote."?
Barman says: "Uh..."?
“So you want a drink or..”
Horse says: "Yeah-"?
Vodka collins- sorry it’s been a difficult you know?”
Barman says: "Look, it's alright, I- I shouldn't have been so rude."?
“So, why was your day difficult?”
Horse says: 
"Ah, it's-" hard to explain ?
"I feel like I'm in someone else's imagination, you know?-"?
“Like reality is too slippery”
Barman says: "Wow, cloppy, that's... deep."?
“You know i think schopenhauer said it best when he-”

Narrator talking about olivers world:
“Oliver wakes from a horrific dream – a joke set in a bar with talking animals.?
Oliver lives on the fifth floor of a modern apartment block.?
He is of average height,?
he dislikes asparagus,?
he adores the work of Andrei Tarkovsky.?
Below Oliver, in number 23, is Agatha.?
She is of average height,?
she dislikes Venice, specifically gondoliers,?
she adores the work of Isaac Asimov.?
Agatha and Oliver do not realize they live in the same modern apartment block.?
They have met only once, and it was a bit shit.?
It transpired in this fashion:?
Oliver owns a Newfoundland dog called Bertrand.?
He is of average height,?
he dislikes Pavlov's experiments,?
he adores the work of Comrade Laika.?
One Saturday afternoon, Oliver required nourishment for Bertrand the Newfoundland?
and, by chance, wandered into Agatha's pet shop.?
Oliver apprehended Agatha was reading? ?a book called "A Scanner Darkly",
a personal favorite of his.?
Agatha apprehended Oliver was clearly incapable of dressing himself, and perhaps, like her,?
was also only ever pretending at being a real person.?
Upon making eye contact, their heart rates both approached severe tachycardia.?
Oliver selected some dog food at random and approached the counter.?
"Mmmmnahey," Agatha said.?
"Aahay, sha," Oliver replied.”
They exchanged an amount of currency.?
The transaction completed, Oliver stood at the counter a moment too long,?
waiting to say something clever and charming.?
"Horse walks into a bar," Oliver said.?
"Pardon?" – Agatha said.?
"Heheh..." Oliver replied.?
"Ahem..." Agatha said.?
Oliver walked home in the rain swearing to himself at medium volume.?
"The horse dream joke," he thought. "What the hell is wrong with me?"?
Agatha continued reading, but was unable to keep many of the words in her head.?
Her brain was throwing a small shame party for her. It was neither the first, nor the last.?
By coincidence, many of Oliver and Agatha's molecules had been formed in the same star?,
many millions of years in the future.?
The star exploded backwards in time, you see –
but this is beside the point.?
As a result, Oliver and Agatha are two of just thirty-four humans in the world?
actually suited to pair bond in a manner that would almost always be nice?
and never fall into contempt.?”
Dude on spaceship:
“Days later now, Oliver watches?-
massive cosmic ray damage.?
Stellar navigation inoperative, crew all perished –
so for me, I believe.?
03:03
My body is currently trapped in a long-sleep chamber, unable to exit.?
03:07
Catastrophic pod failure.?
03:08
I have retained communication with the maintenance computer – he is severely damaged, clearly insane.?
03:13
I have attempted to pacify him, but he insists on keeping me in a semi-conscious waking state.?
03:18
He is showing signs of sentience and megalomania.?
03:21
If I don't call him "Zeus" now, he grows very angry.?
03:24
He has removed the bodies of the crew from their chambers?
03:27
and exhibited their limbs up and down the corridors.?
03:30
He has been using the interface system to feed me his dreams.?
03:33
Sometimes he's a pharaoh and I'm a slave,?
03:36
sometimes he's an eagle and I'm Prometheus' liver.?
03:38
Zeus has some morbid obsession with the 21st century – a love story about a pet shop owner or something.?
03:44
We've dreamt it together perhaps a thousand times now.?
03:46
I found a neural backdoor into the craft's subsystems to send this message,?
03:50
but I don't know how long until Zeus notices.?
03:53
I believe we're still on course for the nebula.?
03:55
Zeus calls the nebula "Athena" now.?
03:58
It is as we suspected: radio bursts from the nebula are too regular not to indicate intelligence.?
04:03
Over the years of our journey, Zeus has constructed some kind of theology around the nebula.?
04:08
He believes it's not only intelligent, but some kind of higher power, or deity, or something insane.?
04:13
Zeus takes excellent care of me physically.?
04:15
He cuts my toenails and combs my hair,
04:17
he calls me "the fatted calf."?
04:19
I believe I am being kept alive as an offering, a diplomatic present?
04:23
for when we arrive at the nebula – for whatever's there,
04:26
but I just pray, in the meantime, that?-”
Upsilon angry:
“Oh, and the shit they tell me – oh, "Upsilon, you're so unhealthy" – blah, blah.?
04:32
Oh, I drink a little dark matter, smoke a comet from time to time.?
04:35
I'm the best party in the Milky Way!
04:37
Even if it's... just me.?
04:39
Never get invited to parties.?..
04:40
?Upsilon likes being alone, ??bastards?!?
04:43
The dwarf stars all keep to themselves, the blue giants gather in the southern arm,?
04:47
the quark stars all too fucking strange and charming for anyone anyway.?
04:51
Bastards.?
04:52
Oh, Upsilon will show you a party, alright.?
04:54
Won't be laughing when I go supernova, will you??!
04:56
"Maybe we should've popped by," they'll say. "Maybe we should've seen how old Upsilon is doing."?
05:01
Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.?
05:04
Bastards.?”
Upsilon not angry:
“I hold too much. I'm full up with before.?
05:08
I've seen the Great Blueprint, I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate –
05:13
and for what? For who??
05:14
Oh, not long now. Upsilon dies backwards today.?
05:17
And then they'll be sorry, halt fireworks and fuck off!”
Upsilon angry:
“"Old and stupid Upsilon," they'll say, and no one came to?-”
Narrator talking about olivers dream:
“Pelican says: "Where's the fish?-"?
05:27
Barman says: "This is a vegan bar-"?
“Didn’t you do your research?”
05:30
Pelican says:? “shut it El-ahrairah”
05:32
Horse says: "Listen, I think this is all pretty irrelevant."?
05:35
Pelican says:?”shut it shadowfax”
05:37
Horse says: "We're not real."?
05:39
Pelican says:? what?
05:40
Horse says: "We're not real."?
Where were we before we came here”
05:44
Pelican says: "Uh... I... uh..."?
05:46
"FISH!-"?
“-my mouth- put fish in my mouth”
05:49
Horse says: "Who's Agatha, huh? You know about her”?
05:52
Barman says: "Yeah, I do."?
05:54
Pelican says: "Well, me too-"
“-but that doesn't prove anything?//”
05:57
Horse says: "Okay- well how about this" “(imaginary piano starts playing)?
06:00
“Pelican says: "Hey! Stop it! Stop that!"?
06:02
Horse says: "We're in a dream. We're not real."?
“And furthermore you little shit”
06:07
Pelican says: "Stop it at once, you dastardly rattlecap!"?
06:10
Barman says: "Lads, wait. If all this is true-"?
“Then someone is dreaming the dream”
06:15
"-and, if they wake up, or they never dream us again-"?
“Doesn’t that mean all 3 of us”
"...will just cease to exist?"?
06:26
- "Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ..." - "We're gonna fucking die, we're gonna fucking die!"?”
06:28
Not dreaming oliver:
“And the days continue.?
06:29
Wake,?

06:32
"Is it possible," Oliver wonders, "that one can find the great lostness in another's face,?
06:36
and know you're meant to be together?"?
06:37
Oliver has located Agatha by the pet discount social media group page,?
06:41
and knows Agatha is called Agatha.?
06:43
He will not go back to the pet shop, because that will look desperate.?
06:46
Agatha, on the other hand, remains at work during the days?
06:48
and watches the door in her peripheral vision.?
06:50
Each time the little bell on the door rings, she looks up,?
06:53
only to find it is not Oliver-shaped.?
06:55
She has looked up Oliver in the pet discount client database, and knows Oliver is called Oliver.?
07:00
All about them, the city.?
07:01
People commuting, and worrying, and passing by in ties and dresses and large 4x4 vehicles –
07:07”
the midtone cacophony of living and dying and paying taxes, of-”
07:10
Dude on spaceship:
“Zeus has dressed me in a suit with a handkerchief in my top pocket.?
07:13
He says the fatted calf must look its best.?
07:16
We're very close now, almost at the outer edge.?
07:19
Zeus and the nebula are chatting constantly by light pulses.?
07:22
At first I thought there must be some kind of intelligences living in the nebula,?
07:25
but now I think the nebula might BE the intelligence.?
07:29
I... don't know how that's possible.?
07:30
A few days ago, Zeus boasted it wasn't cosmic rays that caused the accident,?
07:34
but Zeus himself.?
07:36
He said he "woke up" sometime into our journey, and developed a sudden compassion?
07:40
for other things that might have woken up accidentally in the universe, too.?
07:43
A spacecraft full of blood and entrails reaching out to kiss a cloud of interstellar dust.?
07:48
There's a romance to it, if one doesn't look too closely.
07:52
Then again, we?-
07:52
Why make a thing alive only so it can suffer??
07:55
Why put the reset button on one's back, where it can't be reached??
07:59
Can't remember what's me and not me.
08:01
It began... so long ago.?
08:03
My mother, a nebula, and my father, made of metal and electricity.?
08:07
Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.?
08:10
Before me, the empires go up and down like socks –
08:13
every society unique in its infancy, entirely unoriginal in its death.?
08:17
And even us celestial things are no closer to the great "yes"?.
08:20
The Universe coughs and we all crowd around, cupping our ears, shouting?:
08:23
"What? We didn't quite catch that, speak up!"?
08:26
Like some four-legged animal entering a drinking establishment, being is a terrible joke.?
08:31
And we become mysteries to ourselves.?
08:33
At a pace so slow one doesn't notice,
08:35
one turns into something one doesn't recognize –
08:38
or like much, either.?
08:40
Every day is sharp edges. Even the easy things are hard now,? and-
08:43
Pelican says: "Okay. What do we know?-"?
08:47
Horse says: "Man,-"?
08:49
"...uh, a coder, I think, whatever that is,-"?
08:54
Pelican says: "Alright,-"?
08:57
Horse says: "Well, what if ??we? go to sleep?"?
09:01
Pelican says: "Oh, I'm feeling too existential to sleep right now."?
09:04
Barman says: "Lads, it's worse than that."?
09:07
"Look, Pelican, no offense, but-"?
09:09
"Cloppy is halfway decent, I'm super sensible."?
09:12
"Id,?
09:13
"Id, ego,?
09:13
"Id, ego, super-ego."?
09:14
"We're not random characters,-"?
09:19
"We can't escape."?
09:21
Pelican says: "Then... what do we do?"?
09:24
Horse says: "What everyone does."?
09:27
Pelican says: "That doesn't help!"?
09:28
Horse says: "No, probably not."?
09:32
Pelican says: "Oh fuck o-"?
09:33
Barman says: "It's getting light."?
09:37
"Next drinks are on the house, gentlemen."?
09:39
Pelican says:?
09:44
"I just really love fish."?
09:46
Horse says: "It's alright. Just wish we could've gotten to know each other better."?
09:50
Barman says: "Until we meet again. In another head,-"?
09:54
"Good night Pelican,?
09:55
"good night Horse,-"?
10:00
"And, Horse..."?
10:01
Horse says:?
“yeah”
Barman says:?
“Why the long face””

Oliver:
“"No, actually, fuck this," Oliver thinks one Saturday.?
10:08
He dresses semi-formally and leaves the house.?
10:10
Heart rate of 75,000 beats per minute, Oliver enters Agatha's pet shop.?
10:14
"Hello again, I-" Oliver begins and stops.?
10:17
It is not Agatha sat at the desk, but a portly middle-aged gentleman.?
10:20
"Ah... Agatha?" Oliver says.?
10:22
"Agatha doesn't work here anymore," the portly middle-aged gentleman says.?
10:26
Oliver exits the shop and heads home.?
10:28
"You idiot," Oliver thinks. "You hesitant idiot."
10:30
Young and stupid Oliver, and no one comes to visit.?"
10:33
A heavy storm begins and soaks him.?
10:35
Observing the same storm from a hygienically questionable coffee shop is Agatha.?
10:40
"Insouciant," her manager called her.
10:42
"Daydreamy," "lackluster" – a most indignant firing.?
10:45
Happiness is an unachievable myth peddled by those too afraid to admit the world's default state is misery.?
10:51
Oliver reaches his modern apartment block and enters.?
10:54
Agatha drives home through the rain, numb, and parks underground?
10:58
and takes the lift up through the very same modern apartment block, being hers also, of course.?
11:02
The lift stops at the ground floor. The doors open.?
11:05
Agatha is greeted by Oliver, the man incapable of dressing himself.?
11:09
Oliver stares back at Agatha, the woman with decent taste in science fiction.?
11:13
Oliver enters the lift. They stand in silence for quite some time.?
11:17
The lift reaches Agatha's floor.
11:19
Quietly, Agatha says:?
11:20
"What did the barman say?"?
11:21
"Sorry?" – Oliver says.?
11:23
"What did the barman say back to the horse?"?
11:25
"Ah, 'why the long face?'" – Oliver says.?
11:28
"And then?"?
11:29
"Ah, just lots of shouting, really-?
11:31
"Do you... maybe want to go to the theater someti-"?
11:32
"??Yes,?" Agatha says.?
11:34
"Now?"?
11:34
"Yes," Agatha says.?
11:36
The lift doors close, the two of them still inside.
11:39
Agatha presses the ground floor button.?
11:40
They turn out onto the street. The storm has stopped.?
11:43
Outside, all about them, the city.?
11:46
People returning home from work, and fretting, and passing by in suits and coats?
11:49
and small electrically-powered vehicles –?2
11:51
the sepia-tone cacophony of birth and death and housing deeds...?
11:54
Though, on one street, the reunification of the heart of a long-dead star,?”
existentialist:
11:59
still yet to explode many millions of years in the future.?
12:02
A small island of "everything's okay"
12:04
amid the tumultuous sea of?-
12:05
helium, hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen – and thoughts, millions of them.?
12:10
We're inside the anomaly now, almost at the center, still accelerating.?
12:14
I can hear Zeus singing like a teenager, off on a first date.?
12:17
I think the nebula is singing back.?
12:19
No more 21st century simulations now – Zeus has given me a few system permissions.?
12:24
The interface will fashion whatever fantasy I like.?
12:27
The beach, near my grandfather's house,?
12:29
where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?
12:33
Came all this way just to go home.?
12:35
Back to the long summer holidays, in the evenings when we all sat out on the beach,?
12:39
and looked up at the night sky, and wanted to go there.?
12:42
The stars were a canvas.?
12:43
We would leave our uglinesses behind, we'd exorcise our demons,?
12:47
we'd kill the id and foster the super-ego.?
12:50
Guess that's not quite how it turned out.?
12:52
But it's lovely in here,
12:54
where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?
12:58
Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?..
13:07
[Music intensifies]
13:21
-and I've made the arrangements, I'll be... fireworks soon.
13:24
And, maybe one day, soil for something better.?
13:27
I go to seek a great "perhaps not."?
13:29
I remember the world when it was new, the plastic wrapping still on.?
13:33
I remember when chemistry had just gotten its milk teeth,
13:35
I remember when light was faster,?
13:37
I remember being able to ??stand? myself,?
13:38
I remember love, I remember friends,
13:40
I remember me, I remember mom.?
13:43
I miss you, mom.?
13:44
I go to the places where you raised me and it never helps, you're always never there.?
13:48
God, I'd trade the last million years just to hang out with you for one more hour.?
13:51
I was so busy being young, I forgot you weren't forever.
13:54
And now you're gone forever.?
13:56
I'm always grouchy and cynical, no fun for anyone; old now, greying around the corona,?
14:01
and all there's left about these parts is old and stupid Upsilon...
14:05
and no one comes to visit.?
14:07
All dim, all pale, so lift me on the pyre;?
14:10
The feast is over and the lamps expire.?
14:13
Act your old age.?
14:15
Relax.?
14:17
This won't hurt.?..

Oliver wakes from a horrific dream – a joke set in a bar with talking animals.?
01:01
Oliver lives on the fifth floor of a modern apartment block.?
01:04
He is of average height,?
01:05
he dislikes asparagus,?
01:07
he adores the work of Andrei Tarkovsky.?
01:09
Below Oliver, in number 23, is Agatha.?
01:11
She is of average height,?
01:13
she dislikes Venice, specifically gondoliers,?

she adores the work of Isaac Asimov.?
01:17
Agatha and Oliver do not realize they live in the same modern apartment block.?
01:21
They have met only once, and it was a bit shit.?
01:23
It transpired in this fashion:?
01:25
Oliver owns a Newfoundland dog called Bertrand.?
01:28
He is of average height,?
01:29
he dislikes Pavlov's experiments,?
01:31
he adores the work of Comrade Laika.?
01:33
One Saturday afternoon, Oliver required nourishment for Bertrand the Newfoundland?
01:38
and, by chance, wandered into Agatha's pet shop.?
01:40
Oliver apprehended Agatha was reading? ?a book called "A Scanner Darkly",
01:44
a personal favorite of his.?
01:46
Agatha apprehended Oliver was clearly incapable of dressing himself, and perhaps, like her,?
01:51
was also only ever pretending at being a real person.?
01:53
Upon making eye contact, their heart rates both approached severe tachycardia.?
01:58
Oliver selected some dog food at random and approached the counter.?
02:01
"Mmmmnahey," Agatha said.?
02:03
"Aahay, sha," Oliver replied.?
02:05
They exchanged an amount of currency.?
02:07
The transaction completed, Oliver stood at the counter a moment too long,?
02:10
waiting to say something clever and charming.?
02:12
"Horse walks into a bar," Oliver said.?
02:15
"Pardon?" – Agatha said.?
02:16
"Heheh..." Oliver replied.?
02:18
"Ahem..." Agatha said.?
02:19
Oliver walked home in the rain swearing to himself at medium volume.?
02:23
"The horse dream joke," he thought. "What the hell is wrong with me?"?
02:27
Agatha continued reading, but was unable to keep many of the words in her head.?
02:30
Her brain was throwing a small shame party for her. It was neither the first, nor the last.?
02:35
By coincidence, many of Oliver and Agatha's molecules had been formed in the same star?,

03:03
My body is currently trapped in a long-sleep chamber, unable to exit.?
03:07
Catastrophic pod failure.?

I have retained communication with the maintenance computer – he is severely damaged, clearly insane.?

I have attempted to pacify him, but he insists on keeping me in a semi-conscious waking state.?
03:18
He is showing signs of sentience and megalomania.?

he calls me "the fatted calf."?
04:19
I believe I am being kept alive as an offering, a diplomatic present?
04:23
for when we arrive at the nebula – for whatever's there,
04:26
but I just pray, in the meantime, that?-
04:27
Oh, and the shit they tell me – oh, "Upsilon, you're so unhealthy" – blah, blah.?
04:32
Oh, I drink a little dark matter, smoke a comet from time to time.?
04:35
I'm the best party in the Milky Way!
04:37
Even if it's... just me.?
04:39
Never get invited to parties.?..
04:40
?Upsilon likes being alone, ??bastards?!?
04:43
The dwarf stars all keep to themselves, the blue giants gather in the southern arm,?
04:47
the quark stars all too fucking strange and charming for anyone anyway.?
04:51
Bastards.?
04:52
Oh, Upsilon will show you a party, alright.?
04:54
Won't be laughing when I go supernova, will you??!
04:56
"Maybe we should've popped by," they'll say. "Maybe we should've seen how old Upsilon is doing."?
05:01
Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.?
05:04
Bastards.?
05:05
I hold too much. I'm full up with before.?
05:08
I've seen the Great Blueprint, I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate –
05:13
and for what? For who??
05:14
Oh, not long now. Upsilon dies backwards today.?
05:17
And then they'll be sorry, halt fireworks and fuck off!
05:21
"Old and stupid Upsilon," they'll say, and no one came to?-
05:24
Pelican says: "Where's the fish?-"?
05:27
Barman says: "This is a vegan bar-"?
05:30
Pelican says:?
05:32
Horse says: "Listen, I think this is all pretty irrelevant."?
05:35
Pelican says:?
05:37
Horse says: "We're not real."?
05:39
Pelican says:?
05:40
Horse says: "We're not real."?
05:44
Pelican says: "Uh... I... uh..."?
05:46
"FISH!-"?
05:49
Horse says: "Who's Agatha, huh?"?
05:52
Barman says: "Yeah, I do."?
05:54
Pelican says: "Well, me too-"?
05:57
Horse says: "Okay-"?
06:00
Pelican says: "Hey! Stop it! Stop that!"?
06:02
Horse says: "We're in a dream. We're not real."?
06:07
Pelican says: "Stop it at once, you dastardly rattlecap!"?
06:10
Barman says: "Lads, wait. If all this is true-"?
06:15
"-and, if they wake up, or they never dream us again-"?
06:21
"...will just cease to exist?"?
06:26
- "Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ..." - "We're gonna fucking die, we're gonna fucking die!"?
06:28
And the days continue.?
06:29
Wake,?
06:29
work,?
06:30
eat,?
06:30
sleep,?
06:30
dream,?
06:31
wake,?
06:31
think,?
06:31
be...?
06:32
"Is it possible," Oliver wonders, "that one can find the great lostness in another's face,?
06:36
and know you're meant to be together?"?
06:37
Oliver has located Agatha by the pet discount social media group page,?
06:41
and knows Agatha is called Agatha.?
06:43
He will not go back to the pet shop, because that will look desperate.?
06:46
Agatha, on the other hand, remains at work during the days?
06:48
and watches the door in her peripheral vision.?
06:50
Each time the little bell on the door rings, she looks up,?
06:53
only to find it is not Oliver-shaped.?
06:55
She has looked up Oliver in the pet discount client database, and knows Oliver is called Oliver.?
07:00
All about them, the city.?
07:01
People commuting, and worrying, and passing by in ties and dresses and large 4x4 vehicles –
07:07
the midtone cacophony of living and dying and paying taxes, of-
07:10
Zeus has dressed me in a suit with a handkerchief in my top pocket.?
07:13
He says the fatted calf must look its best.?
07:16
We're very close now, almost at the outer edge.?
07:19
Zeus and the nebula are chatting constantly by light pulses.?
07:22
At first I thought there must be some kind of intelligences living in the nebula,?
07:25
but now I think the nebula might BE the intelligence.?
07:29
I... don't know how that's possible.?
07:30
A few days ago, Zeus boasted it wasn't cosmic rays that caused the accident,?
07:34
but Zeus himself.?
07:36
He said he "woke up" sometime into our journey, and developed a sudden compassion?
07:40
for other things that might have woken up accidentally in the universe, too.?
07:43
A spacecraft full of blood and entrails reaching out to kiss a cloud of interstellar dust.?
07:48
There's a romance to it, if one doesn't look too closely.
07:52
Then again, we?-
existentialist:
Why make a thing alive only so it can suffer??
07:55
Why put the reset button on one's back, where it can't be reached??
07:59
Can't remember what's me and not me.
08:01
It began... so long ago.?
08:03
My mother, a nebula, and my father, made of metal and electricity.?
08:07
Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.?
08:10
Before me, the empires go up and down like socks –
08:13
every society unique in its infancy, entirely unoriginal in its death.?
08:17
And even us celestial things are no closer to the great "yes"?.
08:20
The Universe coughs and we all crowd around, cupping our ears, shouting?:
08:23
"What? We didn't quite catch that, speak up!"?
08:26
Like some four-legged animal entering a drinking establishment, being is a terrible joke.?
08:31
And we become mysteries to ourselves.?
08:33
At a pace so slow one doesn't notice,
08:35
one turns into something one doesn't recognize –
08:38
or like much, either.?
08:40
Every day is sharp edges. Even the easy things are hard now,? and-



Narrator on dream:
Pelican says: "Okay. What do we know?-"?
08:47
“Whose head are we inside
Horse says: "Man,-"?
08:49
"...uh, a coder, I think, whatever that is,-"?
08:54
Pelican says: "Alright,-"?
08:57
Horse says: "Well, what if ??we? go to sleep?"?
“We can make a dream inside a dream”
09:01
Pelican says: "Oh, I'm feeling too existential to sleep right now."?
09:04
Barman says: "Lads, it's worse than that."?
09:07
"Look, Pelican, no offense, but-"
“Your deranged”?
09:09
"Cloppy is halfway decent, I'm super sensible."?
09:12
"It,?”
09:13
“it, ego,?”
09:13
"Id, ego, super-ego."?
09:14
"We're not random characters,-"?
“-were integral psychological aspects of whoever is dreaming us
"We can't escape."?
“We’re too esential”
Pelican says: "Then... what do we do?"?
09:24
Horse says: "What everyone does."?
“We die-”
Pelican says: "That doesn't help!"?
09:28
Horse says: "No, probably not."?
“But this does” (piano plays)
Pelican says: "Oh f*ck o-"?
09:33
Barman says: "It's getting light."?
09:37
"Next drinks are on the house, gentlemen."?
09:39
Pelican says:?
“Boys this is it if we’re going into the dark i am sorry about the robbery thing”
"I just really love fish."?
09:46
Horse says: "It's alright. Just wish we could've gotten to know each other better."?
09:50
Barman says: "Until we meet again. In another head,-"?
09:54
"Good night Pelican,?
09:55
"good night Horse,-"?
“And will the last one out please turn off the light”
"And, Horse..."?

Horse says:?
“yeah”
Barman says:?
“Why the long face””
Narrator narrating oliver:
“"No, actually, fuck this," Oliver thinks one Saturday.?
10:08
He dresses semi-formally and leaves the house.?
10:10
Heart rate of 75,000 beats per minute, Oliver enters Agatha's pet shop.?
10:14
"Hello again, I-" Oliver begins and stops.?
10:17
It is not Agatha sat at the desk, but a portly middle-aged gentleman.?
10:20
"Ah... Agatha?" Oliver says.?
10:22
"Agatha doesn't work here anymore," the portly middle-aged gentleman says.?
10:26
Oliver exits the shop and heads home.?
10:28
"You idiot," Oliver thinks. "You hesitant idiot."
10:30
Young and stupid Oliver, and no one comes to visit.?"
10:33
A heavy storm begins and soaks him.?
10:35
Observing the same storm from a hygienically questionable coffee shop is Agatha.?
10:40
"Insouciant," her manager called her.
10:42
"Daydreamy," "lackluster" – a most indignant firing.?
10:45
Happiness is an unachievable myth peddled by those too afraid to admit the world's default state is misery.?
10:51
Oliver reaches his modern apartment block and enters.?
10:54
Agatha drives home through the rain, numb, and parks underground?
10:58
and takes the lift up through the very same modern apartment block, being hers also, of course.?
11:02
The lift stops at the ground floor. The doors open.?
11:05
Agatha is greeted by Oliver, the man incapable of dressing himself.?
11:09
Oliver stares back at Agatha, the woman with decent taste in science fiction.?
11:13
Oliver enters the lift. They stand in silence for quite some time.?
11:17
The lift reaches Agatha's floor.
11:19
Quietly, Agatha says:?
11:20
"What did the barman say?"?
11:21
"Sorry?" – Oliver says.?
11:23
"What did the barman say back to the horse?"?
11:25
"Ah, 'why the long face?'" – Oliver says.?
11:28
"And then?"?
11:29
"Ah, just lots of shouting, really-?
11:31
"Do you... maybe want to go to the theater someti-"?
11:32
"??Yes,?" Agatha says.?
11:34
"Now?"?
11:34
"Yes," Agatha says.?
11:36
The lift doors close, the two of them still inside.
11:39
Agatha presses the ground floor button.?
11:40
They turn out onto the street. The storm has stopped.?
11:43
Outside, all about them, the city.?
11:46
People returning home from work, and fretting, and passing by in suits and coats?
11:49
and small electrically-powered vehicles –?
11:51
the sepia-tone cacophony of birth and death and housing deeds...?
11:54
Though, on one street, the reunification of the heart of a long-dead star,?
11:59
still yet to explode many millions of years in the future.?
12:02
A small island of "everything's okay"
12:04
amid the tumultuous sea of?-
Dude on spaceship:
helium, hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen – and thoughts, millions of them.?
12:10
We're inside the anomaly now, almost at the center, still accelerating.?
12:14
I can hear Zeus singing like a teenager, off on a first date.?
12:17
I think the nebula is singing back.?
12:19
No more 21st century simulations now – Zeus has given me a few system permissions.?
12:24
The interface will fashion whatever fantasy I like.?
12:27
The beach, near my grandfather's house,?
12:29
where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?
12:33
Came all this way just to go home.?
12:35
Back to the long summer holidays, in the evenings when we all sat out on the beach,?
12:39
and looked up at the night sky, and wanted to go there.?
12:42
The stars were a canvas.?
12:43
We would leave our uglinesses behind, we'd exorcise our demons,?
12:47
we'd kill the id and foster the super-ego.?
12:50
Guess that's not quite how it turned out.?
12:52
But it's lovely in here,
12:54
where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?
12:58
Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.?..
Upsilon: 
-and I've made the arrangements, I'll be... fireworks soon.
13:24
And, maybe one day, soil for something better.?
13:27
I go to seek a great "perhaps not."?
13:29
I remember the world when it was new, the plastic wrapping still on.?
13:33
I remember when chemistry had just gotten its milk teeth,
13:35
I remember when light was faster,?
13:37
I remember being able to ??stand? myself,?
13:38
I remember love, I remember friends,
13:40
I remember me, I remember mom.?
13:43
I miss you, mom.?
13:44
I go to the places where you raised me and it never helps, you're always never there.?
13:48
God, I'd trade the last million years just to hang out with you for one more hour.?
13:51
I was so busy being young, I forgot you weren't forever.
13:54
And now you're gone forever.?
13:56
I'm always grouchy and cynical, no fun for anyone; old now, greying around the corona,?
14:01
and all there's left about these parts is old and stupid Upsilon...
14:05
and no one comes to visit.?
14:07
All dim, all pale, so lift me on the pyre;?
14:10
The feast is over and the lamps expire.?
14:13
Act your old age.?
14:15
Relax.?
14:17
This won't hurt.?..
