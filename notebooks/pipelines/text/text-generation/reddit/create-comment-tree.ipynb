Most of their agendas are for their own financial and personal gain. 2008 financial crisis is a great example of how little they care about us. Now we are entering another financial crisis even worse than 2008 and they are down playing how bad it will be. The white house press secretary recently told the public that we are looking into it a little too much. That the current inflation, import export rates, and interest percentage hikes are not as bad as they seem. People who don't make more than $250,000+ are the ones feeling the pressure. These rich people aren't cutting losses like we have to. They have never had to stand in line at a food pantry, they have never had their electricity turned off. They never had to get into the routine of starving themselves just enough to ration their food proportions for the week. These people spend $100,000 on a wedding dress. $40,000 on funeral flowers. 9 million every other year to move trees around their yard. These people eat like kings. Meanwhile the classes under them are sold into the idea to fill up on food that is killing us. These politicians keep us distracted talking about the child transgender movement, abortion. The U.S has a mental illness issue. The main cause? We are being suppressed. Life is getting extremely hard to get through these days. Financial pressure, social pressure. We are taught that going into debt is always the answer. Our health care system is a joke. Health insurance is a joke. Getting a hirer education you go into thousands of $$$$ debt just to only find a job that pays you $15 an hour. These days it costs you an arm and leg to buy a house. Both spouses are now required to work a full time job to make ends meet. You have to send your children into day care that costs the same as a whole month's worth of rent just so you can keep your job. Most people would like to see their families. With all this financial pressure, and the daily duties of being a mom and dad, there is no time to go visit your cousins, or sisters, or mom for that matter. They don't want to answer the questions that affect most of us Americans.  The rich keep us working class, poverty people under their heel just enough so that they have someone to work for them and cater to their every need. The only way to solve this is for the general American people to band together and fight the system. Work together. Support small businesses, lift each other up. Buy locally grown food and products. Be careful who you vote for. And when you vote, hold those politicians accountable for what they promised. Be careful in what you invest your money into. Be careful on which news media outlet you listen to. We simply cannot live in the world where it is democrats vs. republicans. We need to work together as a people. Stop fighting about the small stuff. We all have common ground, common needs, things that anger us. We need to care about one another. We are all human. It doesn't matter where you came from, what you look like, we are all in this together. We all need to wake up.]\n",
